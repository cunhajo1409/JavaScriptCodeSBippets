// A function that takes 2 arrays.
// Function returns true if each value in source array
// has its corresponding value squared in the target array
// squares in target should occur in the same frequency of occurence as their sources

// Example
// same([1,2,3], [4,1,9])   should return true 9 (each number appears once in source array and their corresponding squares
//                          also occur once in target array)
// same([1,2,3], [1,9])     should return false (square of 2 which is in source array does appear in target array)
// same([1,2,1],[4,4,1])    should return fals (1 occurs twice, in source array, its square only once in target array)
